----Dockerfile-------
Order of instruction in the Dockerfile is important, when updating the file keep the order: 
    1. Base image(FROM python:3.11)
    2. Evironment Set up (WORKDIR to set up directory) 
    3. System level dependencies
    4. Copy application code to the image
        Best Practice: RUN pip install directly after COPY requirements.txt and before COPY ./src
    5. Install the application dependencies (python libraries)
    6. App specific configuration
    7. Command to run the application

----Commands quick list-----------
Create a Docker image: docker build
    use docker build to create the initial docker image from a dockerfile
    Note: This does NOT start or create the container
        CMD: docker build -t dataValidator .
        where "-t dataValidator" is used to specify a name for the built image.
    Returns an id 

2 ways to make a new container and start It: 
    Docker Run Command
        creates the new container and starts the container at the same time
        CMD: docker run dataValidator
    
    Docker Create and Docker Start
        Creates a new container that can be started at a later time. 
        
        CMD: docker create dataValidator
        This will return the container ID

        CMD: docker run dataValidator
        Can be used to start or restart a container.
